## Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

## Installation

1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/AGES-WimBelemDon/frontend.git
```

2. Access the project directory
```sh
cd frontend
```

3. Verify and setup git credentials for the project

Remember to use your academic email

```sh
git config user.name "Your Name"
git config user.email your_email@example.com
```

4. Environment variables

This is a necessary step to ensure the application runs with the correct configuration.
Copy and rename the `.env.example` file to `.env` and update the values as needed.

```sh
cp .env.example .env # Linux-based
copy .env.example .env # Windows
```

## Development

### With Docker

To get full IntelliSense, type checking, linting, and Git hooks working, you need to set up your local environment.
This project provides a helper script that handles everything for you, even if you donâ€™t have Node installed.

After cloning the repository, run (on a Unix-based terminal like Git Bash or WSL on Windows, or the default terminal on macOS/Linux):

```sh
./scripts/dev-setup.sh
```

This script will:

1. Set up Git hooks so that pre-commit and pre-push verifications are in place.
2. Copy `node_modules` folder from the Docker container to the host machine.

After the script completes, start the development server with:

```sh
docker compose up dev
```

To stop the application, run:

```sh
docker compose down dev
```

**Important:**

If changes are made to one of [`Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `package.json`] files, you need to update your local `node_modules` by running:

1. Docker setup (on a Unix-based terminal):

```sh
./scripts/setup_node_docker.sh
```

2. When starting the development server for the first time after that, rebuild the Docker image to include changes:

```sh
docker compose up dev --build
```

### Without Docker

Using Node v22.18, run

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Deployment

The frontend is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages whenever code is pushed to the main branch, as specified on the [pages-deploy.yml file](.github/workflows/pages-deploy.yml).
The deployed site is available at https://ages-wimbelemdon.github.io/frontend/.

However, you can also run the app simulating the production environment locally.

### With Docker

You can simulate a production-ready container with Nginx. For that, you need to copy the environment variables into a `.env.production` file.

```sh
cp .env.example .env.production # Linux-based
copy .env.example .env.production # Windows
```

```sh
docker compose up prod -d
```

The local deployment can be accessed at http://localhost:8080/frontend/

To stop the production container, run:

```sh
docker compose down prod
```

### Without Docker

Thanks to Vite, you can simulate a production-ready build with:

```sh
npm run build
```

Then run:

```sh
npm run preview
```
